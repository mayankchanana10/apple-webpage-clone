<center><h2>Apple Watch can do what your other devices can’t because it’s on your wrist. When you wear it, you get a fitness partner that measures all the ways you move, meaningful health insights and a connection to the people and things you care about most. And it’s always just a glance away.</h2>

<p>Get help when you need it.
Apple Watch can detect if you’ve taken a hard fall and connect you with emergency services if you’re immobile.3 You can also get immediate help in an emergency — even when you’re travelling internationally — by pressing and holding the side button.<br>ECG on your wrist. Anytime, anywhere.
Only on Series 6
With the ECG app, Apple Watch Series 6 is capable of generating an ECG similar to a single-lead electrocardiogram.6 It’s a momentous achievement for a wearable device that can provide critical data for doctors and peace of mind for you.</p>

<p>The difference is like day and night.

watchOS 7 changes everything. You can make
the most of every waking moment with innovations
for watch faces. And your watch works the night shift with the Sleep app.
Watch Faces
Everything you do on Apple Watch starts with your
watch face. With watchOS 7, watch faces are more
customisable, powerful and discoverable than ever.

Faces to make your own
From fun to functional, there is a wide variety of watch faces to try. And there are more ways of customising faces with colours and complications than ever before.

More from every app
One app can now offer many complications, so you can create the ultimate face for anything. If you’re a surfer, you can get the swell size, water temperature and wind speed from a single app.

<br>Sleep is one of the most important aspects of your health, but also one of the least understood. Tracking is a good start, but the Sleep app goes further. It helps you create a schedule and a bedtime routine so you can meet your sleep goals.
See a sleep analysis chart every morning showing how much you’ve slept in the past week.
Sleep tracking
Apple Watch uses its accelerometer to notice the subtle movements associated with breathing and differentiate between sleeping and waking states.
<br>Wind Down
Wound up? Wind Down assists you in establishing a bedtime routine with shortcuts that help you relax, like opening a meditation app and dimming your lights.

Wake Up
Start your morning with a weather report and your battery level. If you get up before your alarm, you’ll be asked if you want to turn it off.</p>

The new Series 5 runs on a new Apple S5 chip inside: 64-bit dual-core S5 processor, up to 2x faster than S3 processor (includes W3 wireless chip). Apple Watch bands now include purchasable gold options including leather straps, something we haven’t seen since the original. The  Series 5 includes 32 GB storage, up from 16 GB from previous models.
Apple continues to see industry-leading growth in the wearables business, thanks in large part to the continued success of its so-called “Hearables” products. According to new data from IDC, Apple shipped 23.7 million AirPods and Beats products during the second quarter of 2020.</p>

The Apple Watch is not just a niche smartwatch anymore. In fact, Apple claims it's the most popular watch — smart or otherwise — in the world. The Series 4 is the latest generation of this product line, and it adds several features that sound great on paper. This includes the ability to take ECG readings, fall detection, larger and better displays that go all the way to the edge, and an improved heart rate sensor.</p>
