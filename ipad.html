<h2>The iPad Air features a 10.9-inch edge-to-edge display with a 2360x1640 resolution, 3.8 million pixels, and a design that's similar to the iPad Pro with an aluminum chassis that features flat, rounded edges that wrap around the fully-laminated display. True Tone support is included for adjusting the display to match the ambient lighting, as is P3 wide color, 500 nits brightness, and 1.8 percent reflectivity.

Apple's iPad Air is the first iPad to offer unique color options similar to iPhone colors. The iPad Air is available in silver, space gray, rose gold, green, and sky blue. What's most unique about the iPad Air is the new Touch ID sensor integrated into the top button, a first for an Apple device.<br>Apple's new iPad Air includes a 6-core A14 Bionic chip, which is Apple's newest A-series chifp built on a 5-nanometer process. Apple rarely introduces a new chip in an iPad before it comes to an iPhone, but the 2020 iPad Air got an A14 chip first. According to Apple, the A-series chip provides 40 percent faster CPU performance and a 30 percent improvement in GPU performance thanks to the new 4-core GPU architecture.

The A14 chip includes a new 16-core Neural Engine that's twice as fast as the Neural Engine in the prior-generation chip, and there are second-generation machine learning accelerators for 10 times faster machine learning calculations.<br>
