<h1 style="font-size:72px">Apple AirTags</h1>
<img src="images/photos/airtags1.jpg">
<p>The AirTag features a small circular design with a white finish on the front and a stainless steel back. You can also personalize your AirTag with emojis, numbers, and letters.

Apple touts that AirTags have a “lightweight design,” and there are two key factors to this: water resistance and a user-replaceable battery. Apple says AirTags are rated for IP67 water and dust resistance, while the battery inside is a CR2032, which is a standard coin cell battery. 

Ordering AirTags
Apple also says that AirTag offers “over a year’s worth of battery life with everyday use,” and features a removable cover for when the time comes to replace the battery. 
<br>
AirTag is splash-, water-, and dust-resistant and was tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP67 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 1 meter up to 30 minutes). Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear.

Integration with iOS
<br>
The true selling point of Apple AirTags is its integration with iOS. It is believed that you will be able to access your item trackers via the “Find My” device on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Once the item trackers are available, there will be a new “Items” tab in the Find My application for all of the things you choose to track.

The item tracker itself will be paired to a user’s iCloud account by proximity to an iPhone, much like AirPods. There is a limit of 16 AirTags per Apple ID, according to Apple.

<p>
Furthermore, you’ll be able to put Apple’s item tracker in “Lost Mode” – which means the tag will store your contact information, allowing other iPhone and Android users to read that information. In such instances, you’ll receive a notification when your item has been found.

Ultimately, what this means is that you’ll be able to attach AirTag to any device – such as your wallet, keys, backpack, and more – and track that item via the Find My app on your iOS device and Mac.

Ultra Wideband
Each AirTag incorporates a U1 chip, which Apple says enables unique precision tracking features for users with the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12. The U1 chip can be used to more accurately determine the distance and direction to a lost AirTag when it is in range, using what Apple calls “Precision Tracking.” 

Each AirTag is equipped with the Apple-designed U1 chip using Ultra Wideband technology, enabling Precision Finding for iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 users. This advanced technology can more accurately determine the distance and direction to a lost AirTag when it is in range. As a user moves, Precision Finding fuses input from the camera, ARKit, accelerometer, and gyroscope, and then will guide them to AirTag using a combination of sound, haptics, and visual feedback.
